# Simulation Practices for panel data
This project starts at 20200916. In order to save my simulation code on Github remote repository, I choose to use github so that I can learn github knowledge with my simulation studies as well. By the way, It's my first official remote github repository experience. (Previously I used Github only for creating my own website.) Congratulates!

Now, let me introduce my simulation practices that I search with "simulation in r" keyword in google, some papers and textbooks.

## Preliminary
### 1. R Simulation Techniques 
* StanfordBios221

### 2. Basic Regression Simulations
* UNT

### 3. T.test, ANOVA Simulation
* Answering question with data

### 4. Log Poisson Model Simulation
* R Programming Data Science

### 5. Simulations for some Statistical Problems
* Modern Data Science with R

### 6. R Simulation Guideline, Regression, Poisson-Log, Binomial-Inverse Logit Model
* Very Statisticious


## Panel Simulation
### 1. Simulation for PanelMatch
* Lagged terms: X, Z. 
* Two-stage: generate T with X, after generating X with Z.
* Two-way-fixed.

### 2. Simulation for GSynth
* Factor and factor loading. 
* Two-stage: generate T with X, after generating X with Z.
* Two-way-fixed: Actually, fixed effects are simulated with random effects.
