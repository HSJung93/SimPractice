# Simulation Practices for panel data
It starts at 20200916. In order to save my simulation code on remote repository. I chose to use github so that I can learn github knowledge with my simulation studies. By the way, It's my first official remote github repository experience. (Previously I used Github only to create my own website.) Congratulates!

Now, let me introduce my simulation practices that I search with "simulation in r" in google.

## Preliminary
### 1. StanfordBios221
r simulation techniques
### 2. UNT
basic regression simulations
### 3. Answering question with data
t.test, anova
### 4. R Programming Data Science
log pois model 
### 5. Modern Data Science with R
simulation for statistical problem solving
### 6. Very Statisticious
r simulation protocol, regression, poisson-log, binomial-inverselogit

## Panel Simulation
### 1. Simulation for PanelMatch
with lagged terms, two-stage, two-way-fixed 
### 2. Simulation for GSynth
with factor loading, fixed effects are simulated with random effects
